Short description
1) 2 sparkle_settings.ini files: strongcutoff uses a relatively low cutoff time for the algorithm (50' cutoff and 2500' for the whole configuration experiment, train instances 1-10), whereas softcutoff uses a generous cutoff time (200' cutoff and 10,000' for whole experiment) which should allow the algorithm to finish instances 1-10 even for time-consuming parameter settings.
2) IMPORTANT: Be sure to adjust the name of the settings file you want to use to "sparkle_settings.ini" and place the file in Sparkle's Settings directory (or copy the contents of the file you want to use to the file in the Settings directory).
3) The number of iterations of the CVRP metaheuristic (SISRs) is currently set to 30k*#nodes. This is 10% of the #iterations described in the original paper, but doing so allows Sparkle to run a basic configuration experiment (see settings files above) in a couple of hours at most.
4) For the toy examples described above, it is recommended to use instances 1-10 (folder X-1-10) for training and instances 11-20 (folder X-11-20) for testing. Using larger instances will work as well, but the cutoff should then be increased to allow the metaheuristic to properly investigate the solution space of a given instance.
