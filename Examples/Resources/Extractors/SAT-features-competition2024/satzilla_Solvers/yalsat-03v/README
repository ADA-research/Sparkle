YalSAT

This is yet another local search SAT solver.

To build run './configure.sh && make'.  See also './configure.sh -h',
particularly the usage of './configure.sh -g' to compile a version
with debugging, checking and logging support.

This will build both the library 'libyals.a' with its API in file 'yals.h'
and the stand-alone SAT solver 'yalsat'.
