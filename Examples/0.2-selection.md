# Use Sparkle for algorithm configution

## Initialise the Sparkle platform

```bash
sparkle init selection-example
cd selection-example
```

## Add compute units

To add a cluster
```bash
sparkle compute add slurm --conf=../Examples/slurm-grace.conf
```


## Add instances

Add instance files (in this case in CNF format) in a given directory, without running solvers or feature extractors yet

```bash
sparkle instance add ptn ../Examples/Resources/Instances/PTN
sparkle instance add ptn2 ../Examples/Resources/Instances/PTN2
sparkle instance add ptn2-7824 ../Examples/Resources/Instances/PTN2/plain7824.cnf
```


## Add solvers

Add solvers (here for SAT solving) with a wrapper containing the executable name of the solver and a string of command line parameters, without running the solvers yet

Each solver directory should contain the solver executable and a wrapper

```bash
sparkle solve add CSCCSat ../Examples/Resources/Solvers/CSCCSat
sparkle solve add PbO ../Examples/Resources/Solvers/PbO-CCSAT-Generic
sparkle solve add MiniSAT ../Examples/Resources/Solvers/MiniSAT
```

## Add feature extractor

Similarly, add a feature extractor, without immediately running it on the instances

```bash
sparkle feature add comp2012 ../Examples/Resources/Extractors/SAT-features-competition2012_revised_without_SatELite_sparkle/
```

Compute features for all the instances.

*Note: maybe add a `--parallel` option to run in parallel. Or the could be configured in the `compute unit`.*

```bash
sparkle feature compute --all --runon=slurm --wait
```

## Run the solvers

Run the solvers on all instances; add the `--parallel` option to run in parallel

```bash
sparkle solver run --all --runon=slurm --wait
```

## Construct a portfolio selector

*Note: The portfolio interface probably need some work/discussions.*

```bash
sparkle portfolio generate port1 --all
```


## Generate a report

Generate an experimental report detailing the experimental procedure and performance information; this will be located at `Components/Sparkle-latex-generator/Sparkle_Report.pdf`

```bash
sparkle report --portfolio=port1
```

## Run the portfolio selector (e.g. on a test set)

### Run on a single instance

Run the portfolio selector on a *single* testing instance; the result will be printed to the command line

```bash
sparkle portfolio port1 --instance=ptn2-7824 --runon=slurm --wait
```

*Note: Maybe a way to select instance in a instane set could be nice. Or we let the need to create them individually for clarity.*


### Run on an instance set

## Run the portfolio selector on a testing instance *set*

```bash
sparkle portfolio port1 --instance=ptn2 --runon=slurm
```

## Generate a report including results on the test set

Wait for the portfolio selector to be done running on the testing instance set

```bash
sparkle wait
```

Generate an experimental report that includes the results on the test set, and as before the experimental procedure and performance information; this will be located at `Components/Sparkle-latex-generator/Sparkle_Report_For_Test.pdf`

```bash
sparkle report --portfolio=port1 --instance=ptn2
```
