\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

@@sparkle@@ \cite{Hoos15} is a multi-agent problem-solving platform based on Programming by Optimisation (PbO) \cite{Hoos12}, and would provide a number of effective algorithm optimisation techniques (such as automated algorithm configuration, portfolio-based algorithm selection, etc) to accelerate the existing solvers.

This experimental report is automatically generated by @@sparkle@@. This report presents experimental results on the scenario of configuring the solver @@solver@@ on the instance set @@instanceSet@@.

\section{Information about the Instance Set}

The whole instance set is @@instanceSet@@, and there are @@numInstanceInInstanceSet@@ instances in the whole instance set. First of all, @@sparkle@@ selected two subsets from the whole instance set as the training set and the testing set. The information about the training set and the testing set is presented as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item Training set: @@numInstanceInTrainingInstanceSet@@ instances
\item Testing set: @@numInstanceInTestingInstanceSet@@ instances
\end{itemize}

\section{Information about the Configuration Protocol}

The configurator used in @@sparkle@@ is SMAC ({\em Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration}) \cite{HutEtAl11}, and the version of SMAC used in @@sparkle@@ is 2.10.03.

During the configuration process, @@sparkle@@ performs @@numSmacRuns@@ independent SMAC runs for configuring the solver @@solver@@ on the instance set @@instanceSet@@; the configuration objective is @@smacObjective@@; the whole configuration time budget is @@smacWholeTimeBudget@@ seconds; the cutoff time for each run is @@smacEachRunCutoffTime@@ seconds.

Each independent run of SMAC would result in one optimised configuration. As a result, @@sparkle@@ would obtain @@numSmacRuns@@ optimised configurations. Each of these was then evaluated on the entire training set, with one solver run per instance and a cutoff time of @@smacEachRunCutoffTime@@ seconds, and the configuration with the lowest PAR10 value was selected as the result of the configuration process.

\section{Information about the Optimised Configuration}

After the configuration process mentioned above, @@sparkle@@ obtained the optimised configuration. The details of the optimised configuration are described as below.

%The PAR10 value of the optimised configuration on the entire training set is @@optimisedConfigurationTrainingPerformancePAR10@@.

\section{Comparison between Configured Version and Default Version on the Testing Instance Set}

After specifying the optimised configuration, @@sparkle@@ would run the configured version of @@solver@@ and the default version of @@solver@@ on the testing instance set. During this phase, each version was performed one run per instance with a cutoff time of @@smacEachRunCutoffTime@@ seconds. The results are reported as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{@@solver@@ (configured)}, PAR10: @@optimisedConfigurationTestingPerformancePAR10@@
\item \textbf{@@solver@@ (default)}, PAR10: @@defaultConfigurationTestingPerformancePAR10@@
\end{itemize}

The empirical comparison between the @@solver@@ (configured) and @@solver@@ (default) on the testing set of @@instanceSet@@ is presented in Figure \ref{fig:configured_vs_default_test}.

\section{Comparison between Configured Version and Default Version on the Training Instance Set}
In order to investigate the performance on the training instance set, @@sparkle@@ would run the configured version of @@solver@@ and the default version of @@solver@@ on the training instance set. During this phase, each version was performed one run per instance with a cutoff time of @@smacEachRunCutoffTime@@ seconds. The results are reported as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{@@solver@@ (configured)}, PAR10: @@optimisedConfigurationTrainingPerformancePAR10@@
\item \textbf{@@solver@@ (default)}, PAR10: @@defaultConfigurationTrainingPerformancePAR10@@
\end{itemize}

The empirical comparison between the @@solver@@ (configured) and @@solver@@ (default) on the training set of @@instanceSet@@ is presented in Figure \ref{fig:configured_vs_default_train}.
