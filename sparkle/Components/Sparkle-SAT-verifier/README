Verifiers are getting passed the instance file name as first argument
and the solver output file name as second argument.

Verifiers are supposed to write a textual (ASCII) integer result code at the end of their
output after a newline '\n' character. There must not (!) be any other characters
(including newline characters etc.) after the integer result code.

Example: "some output ...\nother output\n124332" - 124332 will be the result code.

All result codes that begin with a decimal '1' are interpreted as certificates for 'correct'
answers by the EDACC GUI application and the Web Frontend.

The whole output of the verifier will get saved in the verifierOutput column, its exit code
in the verifierExitCode column.

Please see the provided CNF-Satisifiability verifier for a full example.
