\section{Required packages}

\subsection{On Grace}

Grace is the computing cluster of the ADA group\footnote{\texttt{http://ada.liacs.nl/}} at LIACS, Leiden University. Since not all packages required by Sparkle are installed on the system, some have to be installed local to the user.

Specifically, \texttt{epstopdf} is required for Sparkle's reporting component to work (e.g. \texttt{generate\_report, generate\_report\_for\_configuration}), it can be installed in your user directory as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Download \texttt{epstopdf}

  \texttt{wget http://mirrors.ctan.org/support/epstopdf.zip}

  \item Unzip the package

  \texttt{unzip epstopdf.zip}

  \item Rename \texttt{epstopdf.pl} (inside the directory you just unzipped)

  \texttt{mv epstopdf.pl epstopdf}

  \item Add this line to your \texttt{.bashrc} (open with e.g. \texttt{vim \~{}/.bashrc})

  \texttt{export PATH="/<directory>/epstopdf:\$PATH"}

  (replace "\texttt{<directory>}" with the path to the \texttt{epstopdf} directory)
\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
