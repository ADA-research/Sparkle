\section{Required packages}

\subsection{Sparkle on Grace}

Grace is the computing cluster of the ADA group\footnote{\url{http://ada.liacs.nl/}} at LIACS, Leiden University. Since not all packages required by Sparkle are installed on the system, some have to be installed local to the user.

\subsection{Yahsp example}

\subsubsection{Compiling Yahsp}

\todo[inline]{Check what is needed when the yahsp binary is provided, and add this information to the User Guide}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Install gmp on Grace

  \texttt{wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz}

  \texttt{tar -xf gmp-6.1.2.tar.xz}

  Inside the \texttt{gmp-6.1.2} directory:

  \texttt{./configure}

  \texttt{make}

  \texttt{make check}

  \item Navigate to the \texttt{seq-agl-yahsp3} directory

  \item Add the below after \texttt{-fpermissive} on line 24 of \texttt{cpt-yahsp/CMakeLists.txt}:

  \texttt{ -I /home/blomkvander/lib/gmp-6.1.2/ -L /home/blomkvander/lib/gmp-6.1.2/.libs/}

  (replace \texttt{/home/blomkvander/lib/} with the path where you installed gmp)

  \item Compile yahsp with:

  \texttt{./build}

  \item In \texttt{yahsp/esegui.sh} the line \texttt{\#!/bin/bash} was added to the start of the file to allow Grace nodes to find the 'time' utility.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{TCA and FastCA solvers}
The TCA and FastCA solvers, require \texttt{GLIBCXX\_3.4.21}. This library comes with \texttt{GCC 5.1.0} (or greater). Following installation you may have to update environment variables such as \texttt{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH, LD\_RUN\_PATH, CPATH} to point to your installation directory.

TCA can be recompiled as follows in the \texttt{Examples/Resources/CCAG/Solvers/TCA/} directory:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
unzip src.zip
cd src/TCA/
make clean
make
cp TCA ../../
\end{Verbatim}

FastCA can be recompiled as follows in the \texttt{Examples/Resources/CCAG/Solvers/FastCA/} directory:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
unzip src.zip
cd src/fastca/fastCA/
make clean
make
cp FastCA ../../../
\end{Verbatim}

\end{document}
