% This short package permits you to have things with apparently
% `proper' captions in the body of your text.  This is sometimes
% convenient in documents that only have small `figure's or `table's
% (or small numbers of them) and you don't need to hassle yourself
% dealing with floats (\begin{figure|table}...)
%
% Usage: \captionof{type}[move]{caption}
%        type is `figure' or `table' (or some type you've defined with
%             float.sty)
%        move is the optional moving argument of \caption (the thing
%             that goes to the listoftables/figures)
%        caption is the text of the caption
%
% It's probably best to use \captionof within an enclosing group
% (e.g., \begin{center} fig \captionof{figure}{blah blah} \end{center})
%
% CAVEAT: If you _do_ have `real' (floating) figures or tables in your
% document, you may find this package causes the figures\tables to get
% out of order.  You are (as far as I'm concerned) `on your own' if
% you use this package in such circumstances.
