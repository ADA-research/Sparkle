> A Programming by Optimisation (PbO)-based problem-solving platform designed to enable the widespread and effective use of PbO techniques for improving the state-of-the-art in solving a broad range of prominent AI problems, including SAT and AI Planning.

Specifically, Sparkle facilitates the use of:

 * Automated algorithm configuration
 * Automated algorithm selection

Furthermore, Sparkle handles various tasks for the user such as:

 * Algorithm meta information collection and statistics calculation
 * Instance/Data Set management and feature extraction
 * Compute cluster job submission and monitoring
 * Log file collection

## Installation

The quick and full installation of Sparkle can be done using Conda (For Conda installation see [here]( https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)). 

Simply download the `environment.yml` file from the [Github](https://github.com/ADA-research/Sparkle/blob/main/environment.yml) with wget:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ADA-research/Sparkle/main/environment.yml
```

and run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

The installation of the environment may take up to five minutes depending on your internet connection.
Once the environment has been created it can be activated by:

```
conda activate sparkle
```

```{note}
The creation of the Conda environment also takes care of the installation of the Sparkle package itself. 
```

```{note}
You will need to reactivate the environment every time you start the terminal, before using Sparkle.
```

Sparkle can also be installed as a standalone package using Pip. We recommend creating a new virtual environment (For example, [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) before to ensure no clashes between dependencies occur. 

```bash
pip install SparkleAI
```

Note that a direct installation through Pip does not handle certain dependencies of the Sparkle CLI, such as the required libraries for compiling [RunSolver](https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~roussel/runsolver/).

### Install dependencies
Asside from several package dependencies, Sparkle's package / CLI relies on a few user supplied executables:
- `LaTex` compiler ([pdflatex](https://gist.github.com/rain1024/98dd5e2c6c8c28f9ea9d)) for report generation
- `Java`, tested with version 1.8.0_402, in order to use SMAC2
- `R`, tested with version 4.3.1 in order to use IRACE

Other dependencies are handled by the Conda environment, but if that is not an option for you please ensure you have the following:

- [libnuma](https://anaconda.org/esrf-bcu/libnuma) and [numactl](https://anaconda.org/brown-data-science/numactl) for [Runsolver](http://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~roussel/runsolver/) compilation which sparkle uses to measure solvers meta data. This is restricted to Linux based systems.
- [Swig](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/swig/) 4.0.2 for [SMAC3](https://github.com/automl/SMAC3), which is in turn used by [AutoFolio](https://github.com/automl/AutoFolio).

For detailed installation instructions see the documentation: https://ada-research.github.io/Sparkle/

### Developer installation

The file `dev-env.yml` is used for developer mode of the Sparkle package and contains several extra packages for testing.

The two environments can be created in parallel since one is named `sparkle` and the other `sparkle-dev`. If you want to update an environment it is better to do a clean installation by removing and recreating it. For example:

```
conda deactivate
conda env remove -n sparkle
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sparkle
```

This should be fast as both `conda` and `pip` use local cache for the packages.

#### Examples

See the `Examples` directory for some examples on how to use `Sparkle`. All Sparkle CLI commands need to be executed from the root of the initialised Sparkle directory.

#### Documentation

The documentation can be read at https://ada-research.github.io/Sparkle/. 

A `PDF` is also available in the [repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ADA-research/Sparkle/main/Documentation/sparkle-userguide.pdf).

#### Licensing

Sparkle is distributed under the MIT licence

##### Component licences 

Sparkle is distributed with a number of external components, solvers, and instance sets. Descriptions and licensing information for each these are included in the `sparkle/Components` and `Examples/Resources/` directories.

The SATzilla 2012 feature extractor is used from `http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/SATzilla/` with some modifications. The main modification of this component is to disable calling the SAT instance preprocessor called SatELite. It is located in: `Examples/Resources/Extractors/SAT-features-competition2012_revised_without_SatELite_sparkle/`
